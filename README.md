Inspiration
How this project can improve the quality of life is to see in real time the emotional reaction of what you are saying.

What it does
Based on what the user types in, the sentiment analyzer will assign a score to the statement. Depending on the value of the score will determine what emoji will be displayed on the LCD Screen.

How we built it
Using an Arduino and an LCD, we can display a string of text or emoji.

Challenges we ran into
Originally we were going to use open AI api but there were difficulties using the api key. The next challenge we unfortunately were not able to overcome in time is to use the sentiment analyzer code written in python and use it or translate it with the C code to program the Arduino. We tried to write to the Ardiuno with python directly but were not successful.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Given that our group are mostly complete beginners, Id say that learning a lot and getting as far as we did with the project are the biggest accomplishments.

What we learned
We learned how to interface with Ardiuno, how to use APIs, how to use github, how to set up environments etc.

What's next for Emoji Sentiment Reaction
To get the project up and running.
